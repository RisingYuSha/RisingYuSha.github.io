My research interests include AI for Industry/Science (especially AI for acoustic damage detection and diagnosis) and Physics-Informed Machine Learning / Deep Learning. I have published 11+ papers (<a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=e5ng8m0AAAAJ"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=google-scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FRisingYuSha%2FRisingYuSha.github.io%2Fmain%2Fgoogle_scholar_crawler%2Fresults%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json%3Ftimestamp%3D20251020&cacheSeconds=300&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>) in top international journals and conferences, such as SIGKDD, EAAI, ESWA. Recently, I received the **Best Oral Presentation Award** at *2025 IEEE International Conference on Low Carbon and Smart Energy*. In addition, I have applied for or been granted 4 invention patents and have participated in 4 research projects, including international collaborations and key projects of Shaanxi Province. Furthermore, I have been invited to deliver academic reports at international conferences for many times. And I have been a reviewer for international conferences or journals (e.g. KDD, AAAI, EAAI, ESWA, etc.).
